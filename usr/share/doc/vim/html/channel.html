Vim uses channels to communicate with other processes.
A channel uses a socket or pipes			<b class="vimtag">*<a name="socket-interface">socket-interface</a>*</b>
Jobs can be used to start processes and communicate with them.

Vim current supports up to 10 simultaneous channels.
The Netbeans interface also uses a channel. |<a href="netbeans.html#netbeans">netbeans</a>|

</pre><hr><pre>1. Overview						<b class="vimtag">*<a name="job-channel-overview">job-channel-overview</a>*</b>

There are four main types of jobs:
1. A deamon, serving several Vim instances.
   Vim connects to it with a socket.
2. One job working with one Vim instance, asynchronously.
   Uses a socket or pipes.
3. A job performing some work for a short time, asynchronously.
   Uses a socket or pipes.
4. Running a filter, synchronously.
   Uses pipes.

For when using sockets See |<a href="channel.html#job-start">job-start</a>|, |<a href="channel.html#job-start-nochannel">job-start-nochannel</a>| and
|<a href="channel.html#channel-open">channel-open</a>|.  For 2 and 3, one or more jobs using pipes, see |<a href="channel.html#job-start">job-start</a>|.
For 4 use the ":<code class="special">{range}</code>!cmd" command, see |<a href="change.html#filter">filter</a>|.

Over the socket and pipes these protocols are available:
RAW	nothing known, Vim cannot tell where a message ends
NL	every message ends in a NL (newline) character
JSON	JSON encoding |<a href="eval.html#json_encode()">json_encode()</a>|
JS	JavaScript style JSON-like encoding |<a href="eval.html#js_encode()">js_encode()</a>|

Common combination are:
- Using a job connected through pipes in NL mode.  E.g., to run a style
  checker and receive errors and warnings.
- Using a deamon, connecting over a socket in JSON mode.  E.g. to lookup
  crosss-refrences in a database.

</pre><hr><pre>2. Channel demo						<b class="vimtag">*<a name="channel-demo">channel-demo</a>*</b>

This requires Python.  The demo program can be found in
$VIMRUNTIME/tools/demoserver.py
Run it in one terminal.  We will call this T1.

Run Vim in another terminal.  Connect to the demo server with:
<code class="example">	let channel = ch_open('localhost:8765')</code>
<code class="example"></code>
In T1 you should see:
<code class="section">	=== socket opened === </code>

You can now send a message to the server:
<code class="example">	echo ch_evalexpr(channel, 'hello!')</code>
<code class="example"></code>
The message is received in T1 and a response is sent back to Vim.
You can see the raw messages in T1.  What Vim sends is:
<code class="section">	[1,"hello!"] </code>
And the response is:
<code class="section">	[1,"got it"] </code>
The number will increase every time you send a message.

The server can send a command to Vim.  Type this on T1 (literally, including
the quotes):
<code class="section">	["ex","echo 'hi there'"] </code>
And you should see the message in Vim. You can move the cursor a word forward:
<code class="section">	["normal","w"] </code>

To handle asynchronous communication a callback needs to be used:
<code class="example">	func MyHandler(channel, msg)</code>
<code class="example">	  echo "from the handler: " . a:msg</code>
<code class="example">	endfunc</code>
<code class="example">	call ch_sendexpr(channel, 'hello!', <code class="special">{'callback': "MyHandler"}</code>)</code>
Vim will not wait for a response.  Now the server can send the response later
and MyHandler will be invoked.

Instead of giving a callback with every send call, it can also be specified
when opening the channel:
<code class="example">	call ch_close(channel)</code>
<code class="example">	let channel = ch_open('localhost:8765', <code class="special">{'callback': "MyHandler"}</code>)</code>
<code class="example">	call ch_sendexpr(channel, 'hello!')</code>
<code class="example"></code>
When trying out channels it's useful to see what is going on.  You can tell
Vim to write lines in log file:
<code class="example">	call ch_logfile('channellog', 'w')</code>
See |<a href="eval.html#ch_logfile()">ch_logfile()</a>|.

</pre><hr><pre>3. Opening a channel					<b class="vimtag">*<a name="channel-open">channel-open</a>*</b>

To open a channel:
<code class="example">    let channel = ch_open(<code class="special">{address}</code> [, <code class="special">{options}</code>])</code>
<code class="example">    if ch_status(channel) == "open"</code>
<code class="example">      " use the channel</code>
<code class="example"></code>
Use |<a href="eval.html#ch_status()">ch_status()</a>| to see if the channel could be opened.

<code class="special">{address}</code> has the form "hostname:port".  E.g., "localhost:8765".

<code class="special">{options}</code> is a dictionary with optional entries:	<b class="vimtag">*<a name="channel-open-options">channel-open-options</a>*</b>

"mode" can be:						<b class="vimtag">*<a name="channel-mode">channel-mode</a>*</b>
	"json" - Use JSON, see below; most convenient way. Default.
	"js"   - Use JS (JavaScript) encoding, more efficient than JSON.
	"nl"   - Use messages that end in a NL character
	"raw"  - Use raw messages
						<b class="vimtag">*<a name="channel-callback">channel-callback</a>*</b> <b class="vimtag">*<a name="E921">E921</a>*</b>
"callback"	A function that is called when a message is received that is
		not handled otherwise.  It gets two arguments: the channel
		and the received message. Example:
<code class="example">	func Handle(channel, msg)</code>
<code class="example">	  echo 'Received: ' . a:msg</code>
<code class="example">	endfunc</code>
<code class="example">	let channel = ch_open("localhost:8765", <code class="special">{"callback": "Handle"}</code>)</code>

		When "mode" is "json" or "js" the "msg" argument is the body
		of the received message, converted to Vim types.
		When "mode" is "nl" the "msg" argument is one message,
		excluding the NL.
		When "mode" is "raw" the "msg" argument is the whole message
		as a string.

		For all callbacks: Use |<a href="eval.html#function()">function()</a>| to bind it to arguments
		and/or a Dictionary.  Or use the form "dict.function" to bind
		the Dictionary.
							<b class="vimtag">*<a name="close_cb">close_cb</a>*</b>
"close_cb"	A function that is called when the channel gets closed, other
		than by calling ch_close().  It should be defined like this:
<code class="example">	func MyCloseHandler(channel)</code>
							<b class="vimtag">*<a name="waittime">waittime</a>*</b>
"waittime"	The time to wait for the connection to be made in
		milliseconds.  A negative number waits forever.

		The default is zero, don't wait, which is useful if a local
		server is supposed to be running already.  On Unix Vim
		actually uses a 1 msec timeout, that is required on many
		systems.  Use a larger value for a remote server, e.g.  10
		msec at least.
							<b class="vimtag">*<a name="channel-timeout">channel-timeout</a>*</b>
"timeout"	The time to wait for a request when blocking, E.g. when using
		ch_evalexpr().  In milliseconds.  The default is 2000 (2
		seconds).

When "mode" is "json" or "js" the "callback" is optional.  When omitted it is
only possible to receive a message after sending one.

To change the channel options after opening it use |<a href="eval.html#ch_setoptions()">ch_setoptions()</a>|.  The
arguments are similar to what is passed to |<a href="eval.html#ch_open()">ch_open()</a>|, but "waittime" cannot
be given, since that only applies to opening the channel.

For example, the handler can be added or changed:
<code class="example">    call ch_setoptions(channel, <code class="special">{'callback': callback}</code>)</code>
When "callback" is empty (zero or an empty string) the handler is removed.

After a callback has been invoked Vim will update the screen and put the
cursor back where it belongs.  Thus the callback should not need to do
`:redraw`.

The timeout can be changed:
<code class="example">    call ch_setoptions(channel, <code class="special">{'timeout': msec}</code>)</code>

							  <b class="vimtag">*<a name="channel-close">channel-close</a>*</b> <b class="vimtag">*<a name="E906">E906</a>*</b>
Once done with the channel, disconnect it like this:
<code class="example">    call ch_close(channel)</code>
When a socket is used this will close the socket for both directions.  When
pipes are used (stdin/stdout/stderr) they are all closed.  This might not be
what you want!  Stopping the job with job_stop() might be better.
All readahead is discarded, callbacks will no longer be invoked.

<code class="note">Note</code> that a channel is closed in three stages:
  - The I/O ends, log message: "Closing channel". There can still be queued
    messages to read or callbacks to invoke.
  - The readahead is cleared, log message: "Clearing channel".  Some variables
    may still reference the channel.
  - The channel is freed, log message: "Freeing channel".

When the channel can't be opened you will get an error message.  There is a
difference between MS-Windows and Unix: On Unix when the port doesn't exist
ch_open() fails quickly.  On MS-Windows "waittime" applies.
<b class="vimtag">*<a name="E898">E898</a>*</b> <b class="vimtag">*<a name="E901">E901</a>*</b> <b class="vimtag">*<a name="E902">E902</a>*</b>

If there is an error reading or writing a channel it will be closed.
<b class="vimtag">*<a name="E630">E630</a>*</b> <b class="vimtag">*<a name="E631">E631</a>*</b>

</pre><hr><pre>4. Using a JSON or JS channel					<b class="vimtag">*<a name="channel-use">channel-use</a>*</b>

If mode is JSON then a message can be sent synchronously like this:
<code class="example">    let response = ch_evalexpr(channel, <code class="special">{expr}</code>)</code>
This awaits a response from the other side.

When mode is JS this works the same, except that the messages use
JavaScript encoding.  See |<a href="eval.html#js_encode()">js_encode()</a>| for the difference.

To send a message, without handling a response or letting the channel callback
handle the response:
<code class="example">    call ch_sendexpr(channel, <code class="special">{expr}</code>)</code>
<code class="example"></code>
To send a message and letting the response handled by a specific function,
asynchronously:
<code class="example">    call ch_sendexpr(channel, <code class="special">{expr}</code>, <code class="special">{'callback': Handler}</code>)</code>
<code class="example"></code>
Vim will match the response with the request using the message ID.  Once the
response is received the callback will be invoked.  Further responses with the
same ID will be ignored.  If your server sends back multiple responses you
need to send them with ID zero, they will be passed to the channel callback.

The <code class="special">{expr}</code> is converted to JSON and wrapped in an array.  An example of the
message that the receiver will get when <code class="special">{expr}</code> is the string "hello":
<code class="section">	[12,"hello"] </code>

The format of the JSON sent is:
    [<code class="special">{number}</code>,<code class="special">{expr}</code>]

In which <code class="special">{number}</code> is different every time.  It must be used in the response
(if any):

    [<code class="special">{number}</code>,<code class="special">{response}</code>]

This way Vim knows which sent message matches with which received message and
can call the right handler.  Also when the messages arrive out of order.

The sender must always send valid JSON to Vim.  Vim can check for the end of
the message by parsing the JSON.  It will only accept the message if the end
was received.

When the process wants to send a message to Vim without first receiving a
message, it must use the number zero:
    [0,<code class="special">{response}</code>]

Then channel handler will then get <code class="special">{response}</code> converted to Vim types.  If the
channel does not have a handler the message is dropped.

On read error or ch_close(), when using a socket with RAW or NL mode, the
string "DETACH\n" is sent, if still possible.  The channel will then be
inactive.

It is also possible to use ch_sendraw() and ch_evalraw() on a JSON or JS
channel.  The caller is then completely responsible for correct encoding and
decoding.

</pre><hr><pre>5. Channel commands					<b class="vimtag">*<a name="channel-commands">channel-commands</a>*</b>

With a JSON channel the process can send commands to Vim that will be
handled by Vim internally, it does not require a handler for the channel.

Possible commands are:				<b class="vimtag">*<a name="E903">E903</a>*</b> <b class="vimtag">*<a name="E904">E904</a>*</b> <b class="vimtag">*<a name="E905">E905</a>*</b>
    ["redraw"  <code class="special">{forced}</code>]
    ["ex",     <code class="special">{Ex command}</code>]
    ["normal", <code class="special">{Normal mode command}</code>]
    ["expr",   <code class="special">{expression}</code>, <code class="special">{number}</code>]
    ["expr",   <code class="special">{expression}</code>]
    ["call",   <code class="special">{func name}</code>, <code class="special">{argument list}</code>, <code class="special">{number}</code>]
    ["call",   <code class="special">{func name}</code>, <code class="special">{argument list}</code>]

With all of these: Be careful what these commands do!  You can easily
interfere with what the user is doing.  To avoid trouble use |<a href="eval.html#mode()">mode()</a>| to check
that the editor is in the expected state.  E.g., to send keys that must be
inserted as text, not executed as a command:
    ["ex","if mode() == 'i' |<code class="badlink"> call feedkeys('ClassName') </code>|<code class="section"> endif"] </code>

Errors in these commands are normally not reported to avoid them messing up
the display.  If you do want to see them, set the 'verbose' option to 3 or
higher.


<code class="section">Command "redraw" </code>

The other commands do not update the screen, so that you can send a sequence
of commands without the cursor moving around.  You must end with the "redraw"
command to show any changed text and show the cursor where it belongs.

The argument is normally an empty string:
<code class="section">	["redraw", ""] </code>
To first clear the screen pass "force":
<code class="section">	["redraw", "force"] </code>


<code class="section">Command "ex" </code>

The "ex" command is executed as any Ex command.  There is no response for
completion or error.  You could use functions in an |<a href="eval.html#autoload">autoload</a>| script:
	["ex","call myscript#MyFunc(arg)"]

You can also use "call |<a href="eval.html#feedkeys()">feedkeys()</a>|" to insert any key sequence.

When there is an error a message is written to the channel log, if it exists,
and v:errmsg is set to the error.


<code class="section">Command "normal" </code>

The "normal" command is executed like with ":normal!", commands are not
mapped.  Example to open the folds under the cursor:
	["normal" "zO"]


<code class="section">Command "expr"  with response </code>

The "expr" command can be used to get the result of an expression.  For
example, to get the number of lines in the current buffer:
<code class="section">	["expr","line('$')", -2] </code>

It will send back the result of the expression:
<code class="section">	[-2, "last line"] </code>
The format is:
	[<code class="special">{number}</code>, <code class="special">{result}</code>]

Here <code class="special">{number}</code> is the same as what was in the request.  Use a negative number
to avoid confusion with message that Vim sends.  Use a different number on
every request to be able to match the request with the response.

<code class="special">{result}</code> is the result of the evaluation and is JSON encoded.  If the
evaluation fails or the result can't be encoded in JSON it is the string
"ERROR".


<code class="section">Command "expr" without a response </code>

This command is similar to "expr" above, but does not send back any response.
Example:
<code class="section">	["expr","setline('$', ['one', 'two', 'three'])"] </code>
There is no third argument in the request.


<code class="section">Command "call" </code>

This is similar to "expr", but instead of passing the whole expression as a
string this passes the name of a function and a list of arguments.  This
avoids the conversion of the arguments to a string and escaping and
concatenating them.  Example:
<code class="section">	["call", "line", ["$"], -2] </code>

Leave out the fourth argument if no response is to be sent:
<code class="section">	["call", "setline", ["$", ["one", "two", "three"]]] </code>

</pre><hr><pre>6. Using a RAW or NL channel				<b class="vimtag">*<a name="channel-raw">channel-raw</a>*</b>

If mode is RAW or NL then a message can be send like this:
<code class="example">    let response = ch_evalraw(channel, <code class="special">{string}</code>)</code>
<code class="example"></code>
The <code class="special">{string}</code> is sent as-is.  The response will be what can be read from the
channel right away.  Since Vim doesn't know how to recognize the end of the
message you need to take care of it yourself.  The timeout applies for reading
the first byte, after that it will not wait for anything more.

If mode is "nl" you can send a message in a similar way.  You are expected
to put in the NL after each message.  Thus you can also send several messages
ending in a NL at once.  The response will be the text up to and including the
first NL.  This can also be just the NL for an empty response.
If no NL was read before the channel timeout an empty string is returned.

To send a message, without expecting a response:
<code class="example">    call ch_sendraw(channel, <code class="special">{string}</code>)</code>
The process can send back a response, the channel handler will be called with
it.

To send a message and letting the response handled by a specific function,
asynchronously:
<code class="example">    call ch_sendraw(channel, <code class="special">{string}</code>, <code class="special">{'callback': 'MyHandler'}</code>)</code>
<code class="example"></code>
This <code class="special">{string}</code> can also be JSON, use |<a href="eval.html#json_encode()">json_encode()</a>| to create it and
|<a href="eval.html#json_decode()">json_decode()</a>| to handle a received JSON message.

It is not possible to use |<a href="eval.html#ch_evalexpr()">ch_evalexpr()</a>| or |<a href="eval.html#ch_sendexpr()">ch_sendexpr()</a>| on a raw channel.

</pre><hr><pre>7. More channel functions				<b class="vimtag">*<a name="channel-more">channel-more</a>*</b>

To obtain the status of a channel: ch_status(channel).  The possible results
are:
	"fail"		Failed to open the channel.
	"open"		The channel can be used.
	"buffered"	The channel was closed but there is data to read.
	"closed"	The channel was closed.

To obtain the job associated with a channel: ch_getjob(channel)

To read one message from a channel:
<code class="example">	let output = ch_read(channel)</code>
This uses the channel timeout.  To read without a timeout, just get any
message that is available:
<code class="example">	let output = ch_read(channel, <code class="special">{'timeout': 0}</code>)</code>
When no message was available then the result is v:none for a JSON or JS mode
channels, an empty string for a RAW or NL channel.

To read all output from a RAW channel that is available:
<code class="example">	let output = ch_readraw(channel)</code>
To read the error output:
<code class="example">	let output = ch_readraw(channel, <code class="special">{"part": "err"}</code>)</code>
<code class="example"></code>
ch_read() and ch_readraw() use the channel timeout.  When there is nothing to
read within that time an empty string is returned.  To specify a different
timeout in msec use the "timeout" option:
<code class="section">	<code class="special">{"timeout": 123}</code> </code>
To read from the error output use the "part" option:
<code class="section">	<code class="special">{"part": "err"}</code> </code>
To read a message with a specific ID, on a JS or JSON channel:
<code class="section">	<code class="special">{"id": 99}</code> </code>
When no ID is specified or the ID is -1, the first message is returned. This
overrules any callback waiting for this message.

For a RAW channel this returns whatever is available, since Vim does not know
where a message ends.
For a NL channel this returns one message.
For a JS or JSON channel this returns one decoded message.
This includes any sequence number.

</pre><hr><pre>8. Starting a job with a channel			<b class="vimtag">*<a name="job-start">job-start</a>*</b> <b class="vimtag">*<a name="job">job</a>*</b>

To start a job and open a channel for stdin/stdout/stderr:
<code class="example">    let job = job_start(command, <code class="special">{options}</code>)</code>
<code class="example"></code>
You can get the channel with:
<code class="example">    let channel = job_getchannel(job)</code>
<code class="example"></code>
The channel will use NL mode.  If you want another mode it's best to specify
this in <code class="special">{options}</code>.  When changing the mode later some text may have already
been received and not parsed correctly.

If the command produces a line of output that you want to deal with, specify
a handler for stdout:
<code class="example">    let job = job_start(command, <code class="special">{"out_cb": "MyHandler"}</code>)</code>
The function will be called with the channel and a message. You would define
it like this:
<code class="example">    func MyHandler(channel, msg)</code>
<code class="example"></code>
Without the handler you need to read the output with |<a href="eval.html#ch_read()">ch_read()</a>| or
|<a href="eval.html#ch_readraw()">ch_readraw()</a>|. You can do this in the close callback, see |<a href="channel.html#read-in-close-cb">read-in-close-cb</a>|.

The handler defined for "out_cb" will not receive stderr.  If you want to
handle that separately, add an "err_cb" handler:
<code class="example">    let job = job_start(command, {"out_cb": "MyHandler",</code>
<code class="example">	    \			  "err_cb": "ErrHandler"})</code>
<code class="example"></code>
If you want to handle both stderr and stdout with one handler use the
"callback" option:
<code class="example">    let job = job_start(command, <code class="special">{"callback": "MyHandler"}</code>)</code>
<code class="example"></code>
You can send a message to the command with ch_evalraw().  If the channel is in
JSON or JS mode you can use ch_evalexpr().

There are several options you can use, see |<a href="channel.html#job-options">job-options</a>|.
For example, to start a job and write its output in buffer "dummy":
<code class="example">	let logjob = job_start("tail -f /tmp/log",</code>
<code class="example">			     \ <code class="special">{'out_io': 'buffer', 'out_name': 'dummy'}</code>)</code>
<code class="example">	sbuf dummy</code>
<code class="example"></code>
<code class="example"></code>
<code class="section">Job input from a buffer </code>

To run a job that reads from a buffer:
<code class="example">	let job = job_start(<code class="special">{command}</code>,</code>
<code class="example">	    \ <code class="special">{'in_io': 'buffer', 'in_name': 'mybuffer'}</code>)</code>

							<b class="vimtag">*<a name="E915">E915</a>*</b> <b class="vimtag">*<a name="E918">E918</a>*</b>
The buffer is found by name, similar to |<a href="eval.html#bufnr()">bufnr()</a>|. The buffer must exist and
be loaded when job_start() is called.

By default this reads the whole buffer.  This can be changed with the "in_top"
and "in_bot" options.

A special mode is when "in_top" is set to zero and "in_bot" is not set: Every
time a line is added to the buffer, the last-but-one line will be send to the
job stdin.  This allows for editing the last line and sending it when pressing
Enter.


<code class="section">Reading job output in the close callback </code>
							<b class="vimtag">*<a name="read-in-close-cb">read-in-close-cb</a>*</b>
If the job can take some time and you don't need intermediate results, you can
add a close callback and read the output there:
<code class="example"></code>
<code class="example">	func! CloseHandler(channel)</code>
<code class="example">	  while ch_status(a:channel) == 'buffered'</code>
<code class="example">	    echomsg ch_read(a:channel)</code>
<code class="example">	  endwhile</code>
<code class="example">	endfunc</code>
<code class="example">	let job = job_start(command, <code class="special">{'close_cb': 'CloseHandler'}</code>)</code>
<code class="example"></code>
You will want to do something more useful than "echomsg".

</pre><hr><pre>9. Starting a job without a channel			<b class="vimtag">*<a name="job-start-nochannel">job-start-nochannel</a>*</b>

To start another process without creating a channel:
<code class="example">    let job = job_start(command,</code>

<code class="example"></code>
This starts <code class="special">{command}</code> in the background, Vim does not wait for it to finish.

When Vim sees that neither stdin, stdout or stderr are connected, no channel
will be created.  Often you will want to include redirection in the command to
avoid it getting stuck.

There are several options you can use, see |<a href="channel.html#job-options">job-options</a>|.

							<b class="vimtag">*<a name="job-start-if-needed">job-start-if-needed</a>*</b>
To start a job only when connecting to an address does not work, do something
like this:
<code class="example">	let channel = ch_open(address, <code class="special">{"waittime": 0}</code>)</code>
<code class="example">	if ch_status(channel) == "fail"</code>
<code class="example">	  let job = job_start(command)</code>
<code class="example">	  let channel = ch_open(address, <code class="special">{"waittime": 1000}</code>)</code>
<code class="example">	endif</code>
<code class="example"></code>
<code class="note">Note</code> that the waittime for ch_open() gives the job one second to make the port
available.

The <code class="special">{options}</code> argument in job_start() is a dictionary.  All entries are
optional.  Some options can be used after the job has started, using
job_setoptions(job, <code class="special">{options}</code>).  Many options can be used with the channel
related to the job, using ch_setoptions(channel, <code class="special">{options}</code>).
See |<a href="eval.html#job_setoptions()">job_setoptions()</a>| and |<a href="eval.html#ch_setoptions()">ch_setoptions()</a>|.

<code class="section">Writing to a buffer </code>

When the out_io or err_io mode is "buffer" and there is a callback, the text
is appended to the buffer before invoking the callback.

When a buffer is used both for input and output, the output lines are put
above the last line, since the last line is what is written to the channel
input.  Otherwise lines are appended below the last line.

When using JS or JSON mode with "buffer", only messages with zero or negative
ID will be added to the buffer, after decoding + encoding.  Messages with a
positive number will be handled by a callback, commands are handled as usual.

The name of the buffer is compared the full name of existing buffers.  If
there is a match that buffer is used.  Otherwise a new buffer is created.
Use an empty name to always create a new buffer.  |<a href="eval.html#ch_getbufnr()">ch_getbufnr()</a>| can then be
used to get the buffer number.

For a new buffer 'buftype' is set to "nofile" and 'bufhidden' to "hide".  If
you prefer other settings, create the buffer first and pass the buffer number.

When the buffer written to is displayed in a window and the cursor is in the
first column of the last line, the cursor will be moved to the newly added
line and the window is scrolled up to show the cursor if needed.

Undo is synced for every added line.


<code class="section">Writing to a file </code>
							<b class="vimtag">*<a name="E920">E920</a>*</b>
The file is created with permissions 600 (read-write for the user, not
accessible for others).  Use |<a href="eval.html#setfperm()">setfperm()</a>| to change this.

If the file already exists it is truncated.

</pre><hr><pre>11. Controlling a job					<b class="vimtag">*<a name="job-control">job-control</a>*</b>

To get the status of a job:
<code class="example">	echo job_status(job)</code>
<code class="example"></code>
To make a job stop running:
<code class="example">	job_stop(job)</code>
<code class="example"></code>
This is the normal way to end a job. On Unix it sends a SIGTERM to the job.
It is possible to use other ways to stop the job, or even send arbitrary
signals.  E.g. to force a job to stop, "kill it":
<code class="example">	job_stop(job, "kill")</code>
<code class="example"></code>
For more options see |<a href="eval.html#job_stop()">job_stop()</a>|.
