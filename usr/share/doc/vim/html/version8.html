</pre><hr><pre>INCOMPATIBLE CHANGES				<b class="vimtag">*<a name="incompatible-8">incompatible-8</a>*</b>

These changes are incompatible with previous releases.  Check this list if you
run into a problem when upgrading from Vim 7.4 to 8.0.

The support for MS-DOS has been removed.  It hasn't been working for a while
and removing it cleans up the code quite a bit.

The support for Windows 16 bit (Windows 95 and older) has been removed.

Minor incompatibilities:

</pre><hr><pre>NEW FEATURES						<b class="vimtag">*<a name="new-8">new-8</a>*</b>

First a list of the bigger new features.  A comprehensive list is below.


<code class="section">Asynchronous I/O support, channels </code>

Vim can now exchange messages with another process in the background.  The
messages are received and handled while Vim is waiting for a character.  See
|<a href="channel.html#channel-demo">channel-demo</a>| for an example, communicating with a Python server.

Closely related to channels is JSON support.  JSON is widely supported and can
easily be used for inter-process communication, allowing for writing a server
in any language.  The functions to use are |<a href="eval.html#json_encode()">json_encode()</a>| and |<a href="eval.html#json_decode()">json_decode()</a>|.


<code class="section">Jobs </code>

Vim can now start a job, communicate with it and stop it.  This is very useful
to run a process for completion, syntax checking, etc.  Channels are used to
communicate with the job.  Jobs can also read from or write to a buffer or a
file.  See |<a href="eval.html#job_start()">job_start()</a>|.


<code class="section">Timers </code>

Also asynchronous are timers.  They can fire once or repeatedly and invoke a
function to do any work.  For example:
<code class="example">	let tempTimer = timer_start(4000, 'CheckTemp')</code>
This will make a call four seconds (4000 milli seconds) later, like:
<code class="example">	call CheckTemp()</code>
<code class="example"></code>
<code class="example"></code>
<code class="section">Partials </code>

Vim already had a Funcref, a reference to a function.  A partial also refers
to a function, and additionally binds arguments and/or a dictionary.  This is
especially useful for callbacks on channels and timers.  E.g., for the timer
example above, to pass an argument to the function:
<code class="example">	let tempTimer = timer_start(4000, function('CheckTemp', ['out']))</code>
This will a make call four seconds later, like:
<code class="example">	call CheckTemp('out')</code>
<code class="example"></code>
<code class="example"></code>
<code class="section">Packages </code>

Plugins keep growing and more of them are available than ever before.  To keep
the collection of plugins manageable package support has been added.  This is
a convenient way to get one or more plugins, drop them in a directory and
possibly keep them updated.  Vim will load them automatically, or only when
desired.  See |<a href="repeat.html#packages">packages</a>|.


<code class="section">New style tests </code>

This is for Vim developers.  So far writing tests for Vim has not been easy.
Vim 8 adds assert functions and a framework to run tests.  This makes it a lot
simpler to write tests and keep them updated.

These functions have been added:
	|<a href="eval.html#assert_equal()">assert_equal()</a>|
	|<a href="eval.html#assert_notequal()">assert_notequal()</a>|
	|<a href="eval.html#assert_exception()">assert_exception()</a>|
	|<a href="eval.html#assert_fails()">assert_fails()</a>|
	|<a href="eval.html#assert_false()">assert_false()</a>|
	|<a href="eval.html#assert_match()">assert_match()</a>|
	|<a href="eval.html#assert_notmatch()">assert_notmatch()</a>|
	|<a href="eval.html#assert_true()">assert_true()</a>|
	|<a href="eval.html#alloc_fail()">alloc_fail()</a>|
	|<a href="eval.html#disable_char_avail_for_testing()">disable_char_avail_for_testing()</a>|


<code class="section">Window IDs </code>

Previously windows could only be accessed by their number. And every time a
window would open, close or move that number changes.  Each window now has a
unique ID, so that they are easy to find.


<code class="section">Wrapping lines with indent </code>

The 'breakindent' option has been added to be able to wrap lines without
changing the amount of indent.


<code class="section">Windows: Direct-X support </code>

This adds the 'renderoptions' option to allow for switching on Direct-X
(DirectWrite) support on MS-Windows.


<code class="section">GTK+ 3 support </code>

GTK+ 2 is getting old, GTK+ 3 is here.  Support has been added and it already
works quite well, mostly just like GTK+ 2.


Vim script enhancements					<b class="vimtag">*<a name="new-vim-script-8">new-vim-script-8</a>*</b>
</pre><hr><pre>
In Vim script the following types have been added:

	|<a href="eval.html#Special">Special</a>|	|<a href="eval.html#v:false">v:false</a>|, |<a href="eval.html#v:true">v:true</a>|, |<a href="eval.html#v:none">v:none</a>| and |<a href="eval.html#v:null">v:null</a>|
	|<a href="eval.html#Channel">Channel</a>|	connection to another process for asynchronous I/O
	|<a href="eval.html#Job">Job</a>|		process control

Many functions and commands have been added to support the new types.



Various new items					<b class="vimtag">*<a name="new-items-8">new-items-8</a>*</b>

<code class="section">Ex command arguments: </code>


<code class="section">New and extended functions: </code>



<code class="section">New Vim variables: </code>

</pre><hr><pre>IMPROVEMENTS						<b class="vimtag">*<a name="improvements-8">improvements-8</a>*</b>

The existing blowfish encryption turned out to be much weaker than it was
supposed to be.  The blowfish2 method has been added to fix that.  <code class="note">Note</code> that
this still isn't a state-of-the-art encryption, but good enough for most
usage.  See 'cryptmethod'.

</pre><hr><pre>COMPILE TIME CHANGES					<b class="vimtag">*<a name="compile-changes-8">compile-changes-8</a>*</b>

Dropped the support for MS-DOS.  It was too big to fit in memory.


</pre><hr><pre>PATCHES						<b class="vimtag">*<a name="patches-8">patches-8</a>*</b> <b class="vimtag">*<a name="bug-fixes-8">bug-fixes-8</a>*</b>

The list of patches that got included since 7.4.0.  This includes all the new
features, but does not include runtime file changes (syntax, indent, help,
etc.)
