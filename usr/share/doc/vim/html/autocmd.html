</pre><hr><pre>1. Introduction						<b class="vimtag">*<a name="autocmd-intro">autocmd-intro</a>*</b>

You can specify commands to be executed automatically when reading or writing
a file, when entering or leaving a buffer or window, and when exiting Vim.
For example, you can create an autocommand to set the 'cindent' option for
files matching *.c.  You can also use autocommands to implement advanced
features, such as editing compressed files (see |<a href="autocmd.html#gzip-example">gzip-example</a>|).  The usual
place to put autocommands is in your .vimrc or .exrc file.

						<b class="vimtag">*<a name="E203">E203</a>*</b> <b class="vimtag">*<a name="E204">E204</a>*</b> <b class="vimtag">*<a name="E143">E143</a>*</b> <b class="vimtag">*<a name="E855">E855</a>*</b>
WARNING: Using autocommands is very powerful, and may lead to unexpected side
effects.  Be careful not to destroy your text.
- It's a good idea to do some testing on an expendable copy of a file first.
  For example: If you use autocommands to decompress a file when starting to
  edit it, make sure that the autocommands for compressing when writing work
  correctly.
- Be prepared for an error halfway through (e.g., disk full).  Vim will mostly
  be able to undo the changes to the buffer, but you may have to clean up the
  changes to other files by hand (e.g., compress a file that has been
  decompressed).
- If the BufRead<b class="vimtag">*<a name=" events allow you to edit a compressed file, the FileRead"> events allow you to edit a compressed file, the FileRead</a>*</b>
  events should do the same (this makes recovery possible in some rare cases).
  It's a good idea to use the same autocommands for the File<b class="vimtag">*<a name=" and Buf"> and Buf</a>*</b> events
  when possible.

</pre><hr><pre>2. Defining autocommands				<b class="vimtag">*<a name="autocmd-define">autocmd-define</a>*</b>

<code class="note">Note:</code> The ":autocmd" command cannot be followed by another command, since any
'|' is considered part of the command.

							<b class="vimtag">*<a name=":au">:au</a>*</b> <b class="vimtag">*<a name=":autocmd">:autocmd</a>*</b>
:au[tocmd] [group] <code class="special">{event}</code> <code class="special">{pat}</code> [nested] <code class="special">{cmd}</code>
			Add <code class="special">{cmd}</code> to the list of commands that Vim will
			execute automatically on <code class="special">{event}</code> for a file matching
			<code class="special">{pat}</code> |<a href="autocmd.html#autocmd-patterns">autocmd-patterns</a>|.
			Vim always adds the <code class="special">{cmd}</code> after existing autocommands,
			so that the autocommands execute in the order in which
			they were given.  See |<a href="autocmd.html#autocmd-nested">autocmd-nested</a>| for [nested].

The special pattern <code class="special">&lt;buffer&gt;</code> or <code class="special">&lt;buffer=N&gt;</code> defines a buffer-local autocommand.
See |<a href="autocmd.html#autocmd-buflocal">autocmd-buflocal</a>|.

<code class="note">Note</code> that special characters (e.g., "%", "<code class="special">&lt;cword&gt;</code>") in the ":autocmd"
arguments are not expanded when the autocommand is defined.  These will be
expanded when the Event is recognized, and the <code class="special">{cmd}</code> is executed.  The only
exception is that "<code class="special">&lt;sfile&gt;</code>" is expanded when the autocmd is defined.  Example:

<code class="example">	:au BufNewFile,BufRead *.html so <code class="special">&lt;sfile&gt;</code>:h/html.vim</code>
<code class="example"></code>
Here Vim expands <code class="special">&lt;sfile&gt;</code> to the name of the file containing this line.

When your .vimrc file is sourced twice, the autocommands will appear twice.
To avoid this, put this command in your .vimrc file, before defining
autocommands:
<code class="example"></code>
<code class="example">	:autocmd!	" Remove ALL autocommands for the current group.</code>
<code class="example"></code>
If you don't want to remove all autocommands, you can instead use a variable
to ensure that Vim includes the autocommands only once:
<code class="example"></code>
<code class="example">	:if !exists("autocommands_loaded")</code>
<code class="example">	:  let autocommands_loaded = 1</code>
<code class="example">	:  au ...</code>
<code class="example">	:endif</code>
<code class="example"></code>
When the [group] argument is not given, Vim uses the current group (as defined
with ":augroup"); otherwise, Vim uses the group defined with [group].  <code class="note">Note</code>
that [group] must have been defined before.  You cannot define a new group
with ":au group ..."; use ":augroup" for that.

While testing autocommands, you might find the 'verbose' option to be useful:
<code class="example">	:set verbose=9</code>
This setting makes Vim echo the autocommands as it executes them.

When defining an autocommand in a script, it will be able to call functions
local to the script and use mappings local to the script.  When the event is
triggered and the command executed, it will run in the context of the script
it was defined in.  This matters if |<a href="map.html#%3CSID%3E">&lt;SID&gt;</a>| is used in a command.

When executing the commands, the message from one command overwrites a
previous message.  This is different from when executing the commands
manually.  Mostly the screen will not scroll up, thus there is no hit-enter
prompt.  When one command outputs two messages this can happen anyway.

</pre><hr><pre>3. Removing autocommands				<b class="vimtag">*<a name="autocmd-remove">autocmd-remove</a>*</b>

:au[tocmd]! [group] <code class="special">{event}</code> <code class="special">{pat}</code> [nested] <code class="special">{cmd}</code>
			Remove all autocommands associated with <code class="special">{event}</code> and
			<code class="special">{pat}</code>, and add the command <code class="special">{cmd}</code>.  See
			|<a href="autocmd.html#autocmd-nested">autocmd-nested</a>| for [nested].

:au[tocmd]! [group] <code class="special">{event}</code> <code class="special">{pat}</code>
			Remove all autocommands associated with <code class="special">{event}</code> and
			<code class="special">{pat}</code>.

:au[tocmd]! [group] * <code class="special">{pat}</code>
			Remove all autocommands associated with <code class="special">{pat}</code> for all
			events.

:au[tocmd]! [group] <code class="special">{event}</code>
			Remove ALL autocommands for <code class="special">{event}</code>.

:au[tocmd]! [group]	Remove ALL autocommands.

When the [group] argument is not given, Vim uses the current group (as defined
with ":augroup"); otherwise, Vim uses the group defined with [group].

</pre><hr><pre>4. Listing autocommands					<b class="vimtag">*<a name="autocmd-list">autocmd-list</a>*</b>

:au[tocmd] [group] <code class="special">{event}</code> <code class="special">{pat}</code>
			Show the autocommands associated with <code class="special">{event}</code> and
			<code class="special">{pat}</code>.

:au[tocmd] [group] * <code class="special">{pat}</code>
			Show the autocommands associated with <code class="special">{pat}</code> for all
			events.

:au[tocmd] [group] <code class="special">{event}</code>
			Show all autocommands for <code class="special">{event}</code>.

:au[tocmd] [group]	Show all autocommands.

If you provide the [group] argument, Vim lists only the autocommands for
[group]; otherwise, Vim lists the autocommands for ALL groups.  <code class="note">Note</code> that this
argument behavior differs from that for defining and removing autocommands.

In order to list buffer-local autocommands, use a pattern in the form <code class="special">&lt;buffer&gt;</code>
or <code class="special">&lt;buffer=N&gt;</code>.  See |<a href="autocmd.html#autocmd-buflocal">autocmd-buflocal</a>|.

							<b class="vimtag">*<a name=":autocmd-verbose">:autocmd-verbose</a>*</b>
When 'verbose' is non-zero, listing an autocommand will also display where it
was last defined. Example:
<code class="example"></code>
<code class="example">    :verbose autocmd BufEnter</code>
<code class="example">    FileExplorer  BufEnter</code>
<code class="example">	*	  call s:LocalBrowse(expand("<code class="special">&lt;amatch&gt;</code>"))</code>
<code class="example">	    Last set from /usr/share/vim/vim-7.0/plugin/NetrwPlugin.vim</code>

See |<a href="various.html#:verbose-cmd">:verbose-cmd</a>| for more information.

</pre><hr><pre>5. Events					<b class="vimtag">*<a name="autocmd-events">autocmd-events</a>*</b> <b class="vimtag">*<a name="E215">E215</a>*</b> <b class="vimtag">*<a name="E216">E216</a>*</b>

You can specify a comma-separated list of event names.  No white space can be
used in this list.  The command applies to all the events in the list.

For READING FILES there are four kinds of events possible:
	BufNewFile			starting to edit a non-existent file
	BufReadPre	BufReadPost	starting to edit an existing file
	FilterReadPre	FilterReadPost	read the temp file with filter output
	FileReadPre	FileReadPost	any other file read
Vim uses only one of these four kinds when reading a file.  The "Pre" and
"Post" events are both triggered, before and after reading the file.

<code class="note">Note</code> that the autocommands for the *ReadPre events and all the Filter events
are not allowed to change the current buffer (you will get an error message if
this happens).  This is to prevent the file to be read into the wrong buffer.

<code class="note">Note</code> that the 'modified' flag is reset AFTER executing the BufReadPost
and BufNewFile autocommands.  But when the 'modified' option was set by the
autocommands, this doesn't happen.

You can use the 'eventignore' option to ignore a number of events or all
events.
					<b class="vimtag">*<a name="autocommand-events">autocommand-events</a>*</b> <b class="vimtag">*<a name="{event}">{event}</a>*</b>
Vim recognizes the following events.  Vim ignores the case of event names
(e.g., you can use "BUFread" or "bufread" instead of "BufRead").

The alphabetical list of autocommand events:		<b class="vimtag">*<a name="autocmd-events-abc">autocmd-events-abc</a>*</b>

							<b class="vimtag">*<a name="BufCreate">BufCreate</a>*</b> <b class="vimtag">*<a name="BufAdd">BufAdd</a>*</b>
BufAdd or BufCreate		Just after creating a new buffer which is
				added to the buffer list, or adding a buffer
				to the buffer list.
				Also used just after a buffer in the buffer
				list has been renamed.
				The BufCreate event is for historic reasons.
				<code class="note">NOTE:</code> When this autocommand is executed, the
				current buffer "%" may be different from the
				buffer being created "<code class="special">&lt;afile&gt;</code>".
							<b class="vimtag">*<a name="BufDelete">BufDelete</a>*</b>
BufDelete			Before deleting a buffer from the buffer list.
				The BufUnload may be called first (if the
				buffer was loaded).
				Also used just before a buffer in the buffer
				list is renamed.
				<code class="note">NOTE:</code> When this autocommand is executed, the
				current buffer "%" may be different from the
				buffer being deleted "<code class="special">&lt;afile&gt;</code>" and "<code class="special">&lt;abuf&gt;</code>".
				Don't change to another buffer, it will cause
				problems.
							<b class="vimtag">*<a name="BufEnter">BufEnter</a>*</b>
BufEnter			After entering a buffer.  Useful for setting
				options for a file type.  Also executed when
				starting to edit a buffer, after the
				BufReadPost autocommands.
							<b class="vimtag">*<a name="BufFilePost">BufFilePost</a>*</b>
BufFilePost			After changing the name of the current buffer
				with the ":file" or ":saveas" command.
							<b class="vimtag">*<a name="BufFilePre">BufFilePre</a>*</b>
BufFilePre			Before changing the name of the current buffer
				with the ":file" or ":saveas" command.
							<b class="vimtag">*<a name="BufHidden">BufHidden</a>*</b>
BufHidden			Just after a buffer has become hidden.  That
				is, when there are no longer windows that show
				the buffer, but the buffer is not unloaded or
				deleted.  Not used for ":qa" or ":q" when
				exiting Vim.
				<code class="note">NOTE:</code> When this autocommand is executed, the
				current buffer "%" may be different from the
				buffer being unloaded "<code class="special">&lt;afile&gt;</code>".
							<b class="vimtag">*<a name="BufLeave">BufLeave</a>*</b>
BufLeave			Before leaving to another buffer.  Also when
				leaving or closing the current window and the
				new current window is not for the same buffer.
				Not used for ":qa" or ":q" when exiting Vim.
							<b class="vimtag">*<a name="BufNew">BufNew</a>*</b>
BufNew				Just after creating a new buffer.  Also used
				just after a buffer has been renamed.  When
				the buffer is added to the buffer list BufAdd
				will be triggered too.
				<code class="note">NOTE:</code> When this autocommand is executed, the
				current buffer "%" may be different from the
				buffer being created "<code class="special">&lt;afile&gt;</code>".
							<b class="vimtag">*<a name="BufNewFile">BufNewFile</a>*</b>
BufNewFile			When starting to edit a file that doesn't
				exist.  Can be used to read in a skeleton
				file.
						<b class="vimtag">*<a name="BufRead">BufRead</a>*</b> <b class="vimtag">*<a name="BufReadPost">BufReadPost</a>*</b>
BufRead or BufReadPost		When starting to edit a new buffer, after
				reading the file into the buffer, before
				executing the modelines.  See |<a href="autocmd.html#BufWinEnter">BufWinEnter</a>|
				for when you need to do something after
				processing the modelines.
				This does NOT work for ":r file".  Not used
				when the file doesn't exist.  Also used after
				successfully recovering a file.
				Also triggered for the filetypedetect group
				when executing ":filetype detect" and when
				writing an unnamed buffer in a way that the
				buffer gets a name.
							<b class="vimtag">*<a name="BufReadCmd">BufReadCmd</a>*</b>
BufReadCmd			Before starting to edit a new buffer.  Should
				read the file into the buffer. |<a href="autocmd.html#Cmd-event">Cmd-event</a>|
						<b class="vimtag">*<a name="BufReadPre">BufReadPre</a>*</b> <b class="vimtag">*<a name="E200">E200</a>*</b> <b class="vimtag">*<a name="E201">E201</a>*</b>
BufReadPre			When starting to edit a new buffer, before
				reading the file into the buffer.  Not used
				if the file doesn't exist.
							<b class="vimtag">*<a name="BufUnload">BufUnload</a>*</b>
BufUnload			Before unloading a buffer.  This is when the
				text in the buffer is going to be freed.  This
				may be after a BufWritePost and before a
				BufDelete.  Also used for all buffers that are
				loaded when Vim is going to exit.
				<code class="note">NOTE:</code> When this autocommand is executed, the
				current buffer "%" may be different from the
				buffer being unloaded "<code class="special">&lt;afile&gt;</code>".
				Don't change to another buffer, it will cause
				problems.
				When exiting and v:dying is 2 or more this
				event is not triggered.
							<b class="vimtag">*<a name="BufWinEnter">BufWinEnter</a>*</b>
BufWinEnter			After a buffer is displayed in a window.  This
				can be when the buffer is loaded (after
				processing the modelines) or when a hidden
				buffer is displayed in a window (and is no
				longer hidden).
				Does not happen for |<a href="windows.html#:split">:split</a>| without
				arguments, since you keep editing the same
				buffer, or ":split" with a file that's already
				open in a window, because it re-uses an
				existing buffer.  But it does happen for a
				":split" with the name of the current buffer,
				since it reloads that buffer.
							<b class="vimtag">*<a name="BufWinLeave">BufWinLeave</a>*</b>

WinEnter			After entering another window.  Not done for
				the first window, when Vim has just started.
				Useful for setting the window height.
				If the window is for another buffer, Vim
				executes the BufEnter autocommands after the
				WinEnter autocommands.
				<code class="note">Note:</code> When using ":split fname" the WinEnter

</pre><hr><pre>6. Patterns					<b class="vimtag">*<a name="autocmd-patterns">autocmd-patterns</a>*</b> <b class="vimtag">*<a name="{pat}">{pat}</a>*</b>

The <code class="special">{pat}</code> argument can be a comma separated list.  This works as if the
command was given with each pattern separately.  Thus this command:
<code class="example">	:autocmd BufRead <b class="vimtag">*<a name=".txt,">.txt,</a>*</b>.info set et</code>
Is equivalent to:
<code class="example">	:autocmd BufRead *.txt set et</code>
<code class="example">	:autocmd BufRead *.info set et</code>
<code class="example"></code>
The file pattern <code class="special">{pat}</code> is tested for a match against the file name in one of
two ways:
1. When there is no '/' in the pattern, Vim checks for a match against only
   the tail part of the file name (without its leading directory path).
2. When there is a '/' in the pattern, Vim checks for a match against both the
   short file name (as you typed it) and the full file name (after expanding
   it to a full path and resolving symbolic links).

The special pattern <code class="special">&lt;buffer&gt;</code> or <code class="special">&lt;buffer=N&gt;</code> is used for buffer-local
autocommands |<a href="autocmd.html#autocmd-buflocal">autocmd-buflocal</a>|.  This pattern is not matched against the name
of a buffer.

Examples:
<code class="example">	:autocmd BufRead *.txt		set et</code>
Set the 'et' option for all text files.
<code class="example"></code>
<code class="example">	:autocmd BufRead /vim/src/*.c	set cindent</code>
Set the 'cindent' option for C files in the /vim/src directory.
<code class="example"></code>
<code class="example">	:autocmd BufRead /tmp/*.c	set ts=5</code>
If you have a link from "/tmp/test.c" to "/home/nobody/vim/src/test.c", and
you start editing "/tmp/test.c", this autocommand will match.

<code class="note">Note:</code>  To match part of a path, but not from the root directory, use a '*' as
the first character.  Example:
<code class="example">	:autocmd BufRead <b class="vimtag">*<a name="%2Fdoc%2F">/doc/</a>*</b>.txt	set tw=78</code>
This autocommand will for example be executed for "/tmp/doc/xx.txt" and
"/usr/home/piet/doc/yy.txt".  The number of directories does not matter here.


The file name that the pattern is matched against is after expanding
wildcards.  Thus if you issue this command:
<code class="example">	:e $ROOTDIR/main.$EXT</code>
The argument is first expanded to:
<code class="example">	/usr/root/main.py</code>
Before it's matched with the pattern of the autocommand.  Careful with this
when using events like FileReadCmd, the value of <code class="special">&lt;amatch&gt;</code> may not be what you
expect.


Environment variables can be used in a pattern:
<code class="example">	:autocmd BufRead $VIMRUNTIME/doc/*.txt  set expandtab</code>
And ~ can be used for the home directory (if $HOME is defined):
<code class="example">	:autocmd BufWritePost ~/.vimrc   so ~/.vimrc</code>
<code class="example">	:autocmd BufRead ~archive/*      set readonly</code>
The environment variable is expanded when the autocommand is defined, not when
the autocommand is executed.  This is different from the command!

							<b class="vimtag">*<a name="file-pattern">file-pattern</a>*</b>
The pattern is interpreted like mostly used in file names:
	*	matches any sequence of characters; Unusual: includes path
		separators
	?	matches any single character
	\?	matches a '?'
	.	matches a '.'
	~	matches a '~'
	,	separates patterns
	\,	matches a ','
	<code class="special">{ }</code>	like \( \) in a |<a href="pattern.html#pattern">pattern</a>|
	,	inside <code class="special">{ }</code>: like \|<code class="badlink"> in a </code>|pattern|
	\}	literal }
	\{	literal {
	\\\<code class="special">{n,m\}</code>  like \<code class="special">{n,m}</code> in a |<a href="pattern.html#pattern">pattern</a>|
	\	special meaning like in a |<a href="pattern.html#pattern">pattern</a>|
	[ch]	matches 'c' or 'h'
	[^ch]   match any character but 'c' and 'h'

<code class="note">Note</code> that for all systems the '/' character is used for path separator (even
MS-DOS and OS/2).  This was done because the backslash is difficult to use
in a pattern and to make the autocommands portable across different systems.

							<b class="vimtag">*<a name="autocmd-changes">autocmd-changes</a>*</b>
Matching with the pattern is done when an event is triggered.  Changing the
buffer name in one of the autocommands, or even deleting the buffer, does not
change which autocommands will be executed.  Example:
<code class="example"></code>
<code class="example">	au BufEnter *.foo  bdel</code>
<code class="example">	au BufEnter *.foo  set modified</code>
<code class="example"></code>
This will delete the current buffer and then set 'modified' in what has become
the current buffer instead.  Vim doesn't take into account that "*.foo"
doesn't match with that buffer name.  It matches "*.foo" with the name of the
buffer at the moment the event was triggered.

However, buffer-local autocommands will not be executed for a buffer that has
been wiped out with |<a href="windows.html#:bwipe">:bwipe</a>|.  After deleting the buffer with |<a href="windows.html#:bdel">:bdel</a>| the
buffer actually still exists (it becomes unlisted), thus the autocommands are
still executed.

</pre><hr><pre>7. Buffer-local autocommands	<b class="vimtag">*<a name="autocmd-buflocal">autocmd-buflocal</a>*</b> <b class="vimtag">*<a name="autocmd-buffer-local">autocmd-buffer-local</a>*</b>
					<b class="vimtag">*<a name="%3Cbuffer%20N%3E">&lt;buffer=N&gt;</a>*</b> <b class="vimtag">*<a name="%3Cbuffer%20abuf%3E">&lt;buffer=abuf&gt;</a>*</b> <b class="vimtag">*<a name="E680">E680</a>*</b>

Buffer-local autocommands are attached to a specific buffer.  They are useful
if the buffer does not have a name and when the name does not match a specific
pattern.  But it also means they must be explicitly added to each buffer.

Instead of a pattern buffer-local autocommands use one of these forms:
	<code class="special">&lt;buffer&gt;</code>	current buffer
	<code class="special">&lt;buffer=99&gt;</code>	buffer number 99
	<code class="special">&lt;buffer=abuf&gt;</code>	using <code class="special">&lt;abuf&gt;</code> (only when executing autocommands)
			|<a href="cmdline.html#%3Cabuf%3E">&lt;abuf&gt;</a>|

Examples:
<code class="example">    :au CursorHold <code class="special">&lt;buffer&gt;</code>  echo 'hold'</code>
<code class="example">    :au CursorHold <code class="special">&lt;buffer=33&gt;</code>  echo 'hold'</code>
<code class="example">    :au BufNewFile * au CursorHold <code class="special">&lt;buffer=abuf&gt;</code>  echo 'hold'</code>
<code class="example"></code>
All the commands for autocommands also work with buffer-local autocommands,
simply use the special string instead of the pattern.  Examples:
<code class="example">    :au! * <code class="special">&lt;buffer&gt;</code>		     " remove buffer-local autocommands for</code>
<code class="example">				     " current buffer</code>
<code class="example">    :au! * <code class="special">&lt;buffer=33&gt;</code>		     " remove buffer-local autocommands for</code>
<code class="example">				     " buffer #33</code>
<code class="example">    :bufdo :au! CursorHold <code class="special">&lt;buffer&gt;</code>  " remove autocmd for given event for all</code>
<code class="example">				     " buffers</code>
<code class="example">    :au * <code class="special">&lt;buffer&gt;</code>		     " list buffer-local autocommands for</code>
<code class="example">				     " current buffer</code>
<code class="example"></code>
<code class="note">Note</code> that when an autocommand is defined for the current buffer, it is stored
with the buffer number.  Thus it uses the form "<code class="special">&lt;buffer=12&gt;</code>", where 12 is the
number of the current buffer.  You will see this when listing autocommands,
for example.

To test for presence of buffer-local autocommands use the |<a href="eval.html#exists()">exists()</a>| function
as follows:
<code class="example">    :if exists("#CursorHold#<code class="special">&lt;buffer=12&gt;</code>") |<code class="badlink"> ... </code>| endif</code>
<code class="example">    :if exists("#CursorHold#<code class="special">&lt;buffer&gt;</code>") |<code class="badlink"> ... </code>| endif    " for current buffer</code>
<code class="example"></code>
When a buffer is wiped out its buffer-local autocommands are also gone, of
course.  <code class="note">Note</code> that when deleting a buffer, e.g., with ":bdel", it is only
unlisted, the autocommands are still present.  In order to see the removal of
buffer-local autocommands:
<code class="example">    :set verbose=6</code>
<code class="example"></code>
It is not possible to define buffer-local autocommands for a non-existent
buffer.

</pre><hr><pre>8. Groups						<b class="vimtag">*<a name="autocmd-groups">autocmd-groups</a>*</b>

Autocommands can be put together in a group.  This is useful for removing or
executing a group of autocommands.  For example, all the autocommands for
syntax highlighting are put in the "highlight" group, to be able to execute
":doautoall highlight BufRead" when the GUI starts.

When no specific group is selected, Vim uses the default group.  The default
group does not have a name.  You cannot execute the autocommands from the
default group separately; you can execute them only by executing autocommands
for all groups.

Normally, when executing autocommands automatically, Vim uses the autocommands
for all groups.  The group only matters when executing autocommands with
":doautocmd" or ":doautoall", or when defining or deleting autocommands.

The group name can contain any characters except white space.  The group name
"end" is reserved (also in uppercase).

The group name is case sensitive.  <code class="note">Note</code> that this is different from the event
name!

							<b class="vimtag">*<a name=":aug">:aug</a>*</b> <b class="vimtag">*<a name=":augroup">:augroup</a>*</b>
:aug[roup] <code class="special">{name}</code>		Define the autocmd group name for the
				following ":autocmd" commands.  The name "end"
				or "END" selects the default group.
				To avoid confusion, the name should be
				different from existing <code class="special">{event}</code> names, as this
				most likely will not do what you intended.

						<b class="vimtag">*<a name=":augroup-delete">:augroup-delete</a>*</b> <b class="vimtag">*<a name="E367">E367</a>*</b>
:aug[roup]! <code class="special">{name}</code>		Delete the autocmd group <code class="special">{name}</code>.  Don't use
				this if there is still an autocommand using
				this group!  This is not checked.

To enter autocommands for a specific group, use this method:
1. Select the group with ":augroup <code class="special">{name}</code>".
2. Delete any old autocommands with ":au!".
3. Define the autocommands.
4. Go back to the default group with "augroup END".

Example:
<code class="example">	:augroup uncompress</code>
<code class="example">	:  au!</code>
<code class="example">	:  au BufEnter *.gz	%!gunzip</code>
<code class="example">	:augroup END</code>
<code class="example"></code>
This prevents having the autocommands defined twice (e.g., after sourcing the
.vimrc file again).

</pre><hr><pre>9. Executing autocommands				<b class="vimtag">*<a name="autocmd-execute">autocmd-execute</a>*</b>

Vim can also execute Autocommands non-automatically.  This is useful if you
have changed autocommands, or when Vim has executed the wrong autocommands
(e.g., the file pattern match was wrong).

<code class="note">Note</code> that the 'eventignore' option applies here too.  Events listed in this
option will not cause any commands to be executed.

					<b class="vimtag">*<a name=":do">:do</a>*</b> <b class="vimtag">*<a name=":doau">:doau</a>*</b> <b class="vimtag">*<a name=":doautocmd">:doautocmd</a>*</b> <b class="vimtag">*<a name="E217">E217</a>*</b>
:do[autocmd] [<code class="special">&lt;nomodeline&gt;</code>] [group] <code class="special">{event}</code> [fname]
			Apply the autocommands matching [fname] (default:
			current file name) for <code class="special">{event}</code> to the current buffer.
			You can use this when the current file name does not
			match the right pattern, after changing settings, or
			to execute autocommands for a certain event.
			It's possible to use this inside an autocommand too,
			so you can base the autocommands for one extension on
			another extension.  Example:
<code class="example">				:au BufEnter *.cpp so ~/.vimrc_cpp</code>
<code class="example">				:au BufEnter *.cpp doau BufEnter x.c</code>
			Be careful to avoid endless loops.  See
			|<a href="autocmd.html#autocmd-nested">autocmd-nested</a>|.

			When the [group] argument is not given, Vim executes
			the autocommands for all groups.  When the [group]
			argument is included, Vim executes only the matching
			autocommands for that group.  <code class="note">Note:</code> if you use an
			undefined group name, Vim gives you an error message.
							<b class="vimtag">*<a name="%3Cnomodeline%3E">&lt;nomodeline&gt;</a>*</b>
			After applying the autocommands the modelines are
			processed, so that their settings overrule the
			settings from autocommands, like what happens when
			editing a file. This is skipped when the <code class="special">&lt;nomodeline&gt;</code>
			argument is present. You probably want to use
			<code class="special">&lt;nomodeline&gt;</code> for events that are not used when loading
			a buffer, such as |<a href="autocmd.html#User">User</a>|.

						<b class="vimtag">*<a name=":doautoa">:doautoa</a>*</b> <b class="vimtag">*<a name=":doautoall">:doautoall</a>*</b>
:doautoa[ll] [<code class="special">&lt;nomodeline&gt;</code>] [group] <code class="special">{event}</code> [fname]
			Like ":doautocmd", but apply the autocommands to each
			loaded buffer.  <code class="note">Note</code> that [fname] is used to select
			the autocommands, not the buffers to which they are
			applied.
			Careful: Don't use this for autocommands that delete a
			buffer, change to another buffer or change the
			contents of a buffer; the result is unpredictable.
			This command is intended for autocommands that set
			options, change highlighting, and things like that.

</pre><hr><pre>10. Using autocommands					<b class="vimtag">*<a name="autocmd-use">autocmd-use</a>*</b>

For WRITING FILES there are four possible sets of events.  Vim uses only one
of these sets for a write command:

BufWriteCmd	BufWritePre	BufWritePost	writing the whole buffer
		FilterWritePre	FilterWritePost	writing to filter temp file
FileAppendCmd	FileAppendPre	FileAppendPost	appending to a file
FileWriteCmd	FileWritePre	FileWritePost	any other file write

When there is a matching "*Cmd" autocommand, it is assumed it will do the
writing.  No further writing is done and the other events are not triggered.
|<a href="autocmd.html#Cmd-event">Cmd-event</a>|

<code class="note">Note</code> that the *WritePost commands should undo any changes to the buffer that
were caused by the *WritePre commands; otherwise, writing the file will have
the side effect of changing the buffer.

Before executing the autocommands, the buffer from which the lines are to be
written temporarily becomes the current buffer.  Unless the autocommands
change the current buffer or delete the previously current buffer, the
previously current buffer is made the current buffer again.

The <b class="vimtag">*<a name="WritePre and ">WritePre and </a>*</b>AppendPre autocommands must not delete the buffer from
which the lines are to be written.

The '[ and '] marks have a special position:
- Before the *ReadPre event the '[ mark is set to the line just above where
  the new lines will be inserted.
- Before the *ReadPost event the '[ mark is set to the first line that was
  just read, the '] mark to the last line.
- Before executing the <b class="vimtag">*<a name="WriteCmd, ">WriteCmd, </a>*</b>WritePre and *AppendPre autocommands the '[
  mark is set to the first line that will be written, the '] mark to the last
  line.
Careful: '[ and '] change when using commands that change the buffer.

In commands which expect a file name, you can use "<code class="special">&lt;afile&gt;</code>" for the file name
that is being read |<a href="cmdline.html#:%3Cafile%3E">:&lt;afile&gt;</a>| (you can also use "%" for the current file
name).  "<code class="special">&lt;abuf&gt;</code>" can be used for the buffer number of the currently effective
buffer.  This also works for buffers that doesn't have a name.  But it doesn't
work for files without a buffer (e.g., with ":r file").

							<b class="vimtag">*<a name="gzip-example">gzip-example</a>*</b>
Examples for reading and writing compressed files:
<code class="example">  :augroup gzip</code>
<code class="example">  :  autocmd!</code>
<code class="example">  :  autocmd BufReadPre,FileReadPre	*.gz set bin</code>
<code class="example">  :  autocmd BufReadPost,FileReadPost	*.gz '[,']!gunzip</code>
<code class="example">  :  autocmd BufReadPost,FileReadPost	*.gz set nobin</code>
<code class="example">  :  autocmd BufReadPost,FileReadPost	*.gz execute ":doautocmd BufReadPost " . expand("%:r")</code>
<code class="example">  :  autocmd BufWritePost,FileWritePost	*.gz !mv <code class="special">&lt;afile&gt;</code> <code class="special">&lt;afile&gt;</code>:r</code>
<code class="example">  :  autocmd BufWritePost,FileWritePost	*.gz !gzip <code class="special">&lt;afile&gt;</code>:r</code>
<code class="example"></code>
<code class="example">  :  autocmd FileAppendPre		*.gz !gunzip <code class="special">&lt;afile&gt;</code></code>
<code class="example">  :  autocmd FileAppendPre		*.gz !mv <code class="special">&lt;afile&gt;</code>:r <code class="special">&lt;afile&gt;</code></code>
<code class="example">  :  autocmd FileAppendPost		*.gz !mv <code class="special">&lt;afile&gt;</code> <code class="special">&lt;afile&gt;</code>:r</code>
<code class="example">  :  autocmd FileAppendPost		*.gz !gzip <code class="special">&lt;afile&gt;</code>:r</code>
<code class="example">  :augroup END</code>
<code class="example"></code>
The "gzip" group is used to be able to delete any existing autocommands with
":autocmd!", for when the file is sourced twice.

("<code class="special">&lt;afile&gt;</code>:r" is the file name without the extension, see |<a href="cmdline.html#:_%:">:_%:</a>|)

The commands executed for the BufNewFile, BufRead/BufReadPost, BufWritePost,
FileAppendPost and VimLeave events do not set or reset the changed flag of the
buffer.  When you decompress the buffer with the BufReadPost autocommands, you
can still exit with ":q".  When you use ":undo" in BufWritePost to undo the
changes made by BufWritePre commands, you can still do ":q" (this also makes
"ZZ" work).  If you do want the buffer to be marked as modified, set the
'modified' option.

To execute Normal mode commands from an autocommand, use the ":normal"
command.  Use with care!  If the Normal mode command is not finished, the user
needs to type characters (e.g., after ":normal m" you need to type a mark
name).

If you want the buffer to be unmodified after changing it, reset the
'modified' option.  This makes it possible to exit the buffer with ":q"
instead of ":q!".

							<b class="vimtag">*<a name="autocmd-nested">autocmd-nested</a>*</b> <b class="vimtag">*<a name="E218">E218</a>*</b>
By default, autocommands do not nest.  If you use ":e" or ":w" in an
autocommand, Vim does not execute the BufRead and BufWrite autocommands for
those commands.  If you do want this, use the "nested" flag for those commands
in which you want nesting.  For example:
<code class="example">  :autocmd FileChangedShell *.c nested e!</code>
The nesting is limited to 10 levels to get out of recursive loops.

It's possible to use the ":au" command in an autocommand.  This can be a
self-modifying command!  This can be useful for an autocommand that should
execute only once.

If you want to skip autocommands for one command, use the |<a href="autocmd.html#:noautocmd">:noautocmd</a>| command
modifier or the 'eventignore' option.

<code class="note">Note:</code> When reading a file (with ":read file" or with a filter command) and the
last line in the file does not have an <code class="special">&lt;EOL&gt;</code>, Vim remembers this.  At the next
write (with ":write file" or with a filter command), if the same line is
written again as the last line in a file AND 'binary' is set, Vim does not
supply an <code class="special">&lt;EOL&gt;</code>.  This makes a filter command on the just read lines write the
same file as was read, and makes a write command on just filtered lines write
the same file as was read from the filter.  For example, another way to write
a compressed file:
<code class="example"></code>
<code class="example">  :autocmd FileWritePre *.gz   set bin|'[,']!gzip</code>
<code class="example">  :autocmd FileWritePost *.gz  undo|set nobin</code>

<code class="example">  :autocmd BufWritePre,FileWritePre *.html   ks|<code class="badlink">call LastMod()</code>|'s</code>
<code class="example">  :fun LastMod()</code>
<code class="example">  :  if line("$") &gt; 20</code>
<code class="example">  :    let l = 20</code>
<code class="example">  :  else</code>
<code class="example">  :    let l = line("$")</code>
<code class="example">  :  endif</code>
<code class="example">  :  exe "1," . l . "g/Last modified: /s/Last modified: .*/Last modified: " .</code>
<code class="example">  :  \ strftime("%Y %b %d")</code>
<code class="example">  :endfun</code>
<code class="example"></code>
You need to have a line "Last modified: <code class="special">&lt;date time&gt;</code>" in the first 20 lines
of the file for this to work.  Vim replaces <code class="special">&lt;date time&gt;</code> (and anything in the
same line after it) with the current date and time.  Explanation:
	ks		mark current position with mark 's'
	call LastMod()  call the LastMod() function to do the work
	's		return the cursor to the old position
The LastMod() function checks if the file is shorter than 20 lines, and then
uses the ":g" command to find lines that contain "Last modified: ".  For those
lines the ":s" command is executed to replace the existing date with the
current one.  The ":execute" command is used to be able to use an expression
for the ":g" and ":s" commands.  The date is obtained with the strftime()
function.  You can change its argument to get another date string.

When entering :autocmd on the command-line, completion of events and command
names may be done (with <code class="special">&lt;Tab&gt;</code>, <code class="keystroke">CTRL-D</code>, etc.) where appropriate.

Vim executes all matching autocommands in the order that you specify them.
It is recommended that your first autocommand be used for all files by using
"*" as the file pattern.  This means that you can define defaults you like
here for any settings, and if there is another matching autocommand it will
override these.  But if there is no other matching autocommand, then at least
your default settings are recovered (if entering this file from another for
which autocommands did match).  <code class="note">Note</code> that "*" will also match files starting
with ".", unlike Unix shells.

						    <b class="vimtag">*<a name="autocmd-searchpat">autocmd-searchpat</a>*</b>
Autocommands do not change the current search patterns.  Vim saves the current
search patterns before executing autocommands then restores them after the
autocommands finish.  This means that autocommands do not affect the strings
highlighted with the 'hlsearch' option.  Within autocommands, you can still
use search patterns normally, e.g., with the "n" command.
If you want an autocommand to set the search pattern, such that it is used
after the autocommand finishes, use the ":let @/ =" command.
The search-highlighting cannot be switched off with ":nohlsearch" in an
autocommand.  Use the 'h' flag in the 'viminfo' option to disable search-
highlighting when starting Vim.

							<b class="vimtag">*<a name="Cmd-event">Cmd-event</a>*</b>
When using one of the "*Cmd" events, the matching autocommands are expected to
do the file reading, writing or sourcing.  This can be used when working with
a special kind of file, for example on a remote system.
CAREFUL: If you use these events in a wrong way, it may have the effect of
making it impossible to read or write the matching files!  Make sure you test
your autocommands properly.  Best is to use a pattern that will never match a
normal file name, for example "ftp://*".

When defining a BufReadCmd it will be difficult for Vim to recover a crashed
editing session.  When recovering from the original file, Vim reads only those
parts of a file that are not found in the swap file.  Since that is not
possible with a BufReadCmd, use the |<a href="recover.html#:preserve">:preserve</a>| command to make sure the
original file isn't needed for recovery.  You might want to do this only when
you expect the file to be modified.

For file read and write commands the |<a href="eval.html#v:cmdarg">v:cmdarg</a>| variable holds the "++enc="
and "++ff=" argument that are effective.  These should be used for the command
that reads/writes the file.  The |<a href="eval.html#v:cmdbang">v:cmdbang</a>| variable is one when "!" was
used, zero otherwise.

See the $VIMRUNTIME/plugin/netrwPlugin.vim for examples.

</pre><hr><pre>11. Disabling autocommands				<b class="vimtag">*<a name="autocmd-disable">autocmd-disable</a>*</b>

To disable autocommands for some time use the 'eventignore' option.  <code class="note">Note</code> that
this may cause unexpected behavior, make sure you restore 'eventignore'
afterwards, using a |<a href="eval.html#:try">:try</a>| block with |<a href="eval.html#:finally">:finally</a>|.

							<b class="vimtag">*<a name=":noautocmd">:noautocmd</a>*</b> <b class="vimtag">*<a name=":noa">:noa</a>*</b>
To disable autocommands for just one command use the ":noautocmd" command
modifier.  This will set 'eventignore' to "all" for the duration of the
following command.  Example:
<code class="example"></code>
<code class="example">	:noautocmd w fname.gz</code>
<code class="example"></code>
This will write the file without triggering the autocommands defined by the
gzip plugin.
